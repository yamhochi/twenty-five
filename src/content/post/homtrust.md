## Background

Homtrust serves as the dedicated accounting platform to oversee the full spectrum of services within the Homstar ecosystem, encompassing Homhero, Homdesk, Homsure, Homguard, and Hompay. Prior to its inception, these services were reliant on a third-party software vendor, a setup that presented a host of challenges and eroded client trust.

In response to these issues and to better meet customer needs, Thinkmill was commissioned to spearhead the development of Homtrust as an in-house proprietary solution for the business.

## Current state

The current solution is a white-labeled third-party service that has been customized to address the specific trust accounting needs of the Short-Term Rental (STR) industry. However, despite these customizations, the platform remains insufficient. Its outdated design, limited flexibility, and susceptibility to errors fail to meet the growing demands of the business, leading to inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and reduced client confidence.

## Rebuilding from 0 to 1

Given the current limitations of the white-labeled third-party service, Thinkmill is focused on developing a bespoke, in-house accounting solution that is fully tailored to the specific needs of the Short-Term Rental (STR) industry. This solution will ensure:

**STR Industry Compliance**
A robust accounting engine designed to meet the unique regulatory and operational requirements of the STR sector.
And, a configurable system that strikes the right balance between control and flexibility, allowing for seamless adaptation to evolving business needs.

**Simplified Receipt and Reconciliation**
Streamlined workflows to reduce risk and enhance trust. And, clear communication of potential issues, along with actionable insights to diagnose and resolve errors efficiently.

**Timely Payments and Intelligent Disbursement**
Intelligent invoice allocation systems to ensure creditors are paid accurately and on time and an automated processes to minimize delays and discrepancies in payment cycles.

## Design's role

As Design Lead, I managed the dual challenge of balancing two distinct streams of work: tackling the complex UX needs of trust accounting and crafting a modern, cohesive UI. This required close collaboration with cross-functional teams to deliver a solution that was both highly functional and visually engaging.

**UX Stream: Simplifying Complexity and Redesigning Workflows**
The UX stream focused on understanding user pain points and redesigning complex accounting flows to be intuitive and error-resistant. Rapid prototyping and iterative validation ensured the workflows aligned with user needs and business objectives.

**UI Stream: Establishing Standards and Enhancing Visual Experience**
The UI stream created a consistent design system to unify the platformâ€™s look and feel. Close collaboration with front-end developers ensured seamless implementation, enhancing usability while delivering a polished and professional interface.

My role was to facilitate and workshop the "as-is" state, deeply understanding accounting requirements, technological limitations, legal compliance, and business processes necessary to perform an end-to-end trust accounting task. From there, I translated these complexities into simpler and more logical workflows to ensure both usability and efficiency.

## UI Considerations

When it came to the interface elements, these were some of the key UI considerations in crafting the Homtrust interface:

**Consistent but not forceful**
Ensuring the design foundations were easy to understand and scalable while maintaining visual cohesion.

**Factual but not boring**
Leveraging visual elements like iconography and microcopy to bring clarity and approachability to a data-heavy platform.

**Dense but not overwhelming**
Adopting a schema-led design approach to prioritize and present information gradually, guiding users through the interface in a digestible way.

The outcome of our collective efforts was the empowerment of customers to carry out end-to-end accounting functions more effectively than before. This achievement not only rekindled trust among existing clients but also allowed the business to refocus on its growth and business goals.

In summary, the development of Homtrust in 2023 represented a significant turning point for Homstar. It addressed pressing challenges, restored customer confidence, and facilitated the seamless integration of a specialized accounting platform within the Homstar ecosystem. The design-led, domain-driven approach, combined with a focus on simplicity and completeness, not only improved customer experiences but also positioned the business for sustained growth and success.
