					Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Andie (she/her), this is a place where I document my journey working in
					software & design since 2014.
				</p>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					In my previous life, I was an excel whiz & map wrangler helping economists and town
					planners make better policy decisions with data. As digital transformations took hold in
					that field, I found myself drawn to software development, sparking my interest in code,
					product creation, and design.
				</p>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					I'm passionate about improving digital inclusiveness through innovative technology. I am
					aware that design choices can profoundly impact how people experience technology,
					especially those who are encountering it for the first time. This fuels my ongoing passion
					for creating meaningful change through innovation.
